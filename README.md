The package adds support for the iBIT conroller board from Innovative Experiment [INEX](https://inex.co.th).

### micro:bit Pin Assignment

The following micro:bit pins are used for analog and digital sensors, DC motor drivers and servo motors:

* ``P0`` -- Analog Input 0 (micro:bit default)
* ``P1`` -- Analog Input 1 (micro:bit default)
* ``P2`` -- Analog Input 2 (micro:bit default)
* ``P8`` -- Digital Input/Output and AnalogWrite/Servo1
* ``P12`` -- Digital Input/Output and AnalogWrite/Servo2
* ``P13`` -- DigitalWrite Pin for DC motor control direction 1
* ``P14`` -- AnalogWrite Pin for DC motor speed control 1
* ``P15`` -- DigitalWrite Pin for DC motor control direction 2
* ``P16`` -- AnalogWrite Pin for DC motor speed control 2
* ``P19`` -- SCL connected to I2C-based 12-bit ADC chip (ADS7828)
* ``P20`` -- SDA connected to I2C-based 12-bit ADC chip (ADS7828)

### Motor control Block

Use iBIT's motor block to drives motor forward and backward. The speed motor is adjustable between 0 to 100.

* The dirrection must be select either `Forward` or `Backward`
* Speed is an integer value between `0 - 100`


```blocks
iBIT.Motor(motor.Forward, 100)

iBIT.Motor(motor.Backward, 100)
```

### Spin Block

Spin block is used to control both motors separately. For example, choose one motor spin with forward direction another one spin with backward direction.

* The Spin select direction must be either `Left` or `Right`
* Speed is an integer value between `0 - 100`

```blocks
iBIT.Spin(spin.Left, 100)

iBIT.Spin(spin.Right, 100)
```

### Turn Block

The Turn block is used to to control the robot movment by turning. The one motor will stop, another one is moving. The vipot point is a center of the robot body.

* The Turn select direction must be either `Left` or `Right`
* Speed is an integer value between `0 - 100`

```blocks
iBIT.Turn(turn.Left, 100)

iBIT.Turn(turn.Right, 100)
```

### Motor Stop Block 

The Motor Stop block is used to stop both motors. The speed is set to `0` automatic.

```blocks
iBIT.MotorStop()
```

### Servo Block

Use this block for control the servo's moving degree from 0 to 180

* Degree is an integer value between `0 - 180`

```blocks
iBIT.Servo(servo.SV1, 90)
```

### ReadAD Block

This block is used to read the analog input data from the I2C-based ADC integrated circuit, ADS7828. The resolution of conversion is 12-bit. Data will be 0 to 4095. iBIT have 8-ch analog inputs. The pinout voltage range is 0 to +3.3V

* Analog sensor port are `ADC0 - ADC7`
* Select analog channel from `ADC0 - ADC7` for reading the analog sensor.
* Get the analog value to set the conditions for the robot's mission.

```block
iBIT.ReadADC(readADC.ADC0)
```

### Example

* Read the analog input 0 and display the conversion data on micro:bit. User can change the analog channel any time.

```blocks
basic.showNumber(iBIT.ReadADC(readADC.ADC0))
```

* Drive the motors with Forward and Backward by counting speed `0 - 100`

```blocks
let speed = 0
basic.forever(() => {
    for (let speed = 0; speed <= 100; speed++) {
        iBIT.Motor(motor.Forward, speed)
        basic.pause(50)
    }
    for (let speed = 0; speed <= 100; speed++) {
        iBIT.Motor(motor.Backward, speed)
        basic.pause(50)
    }
})
```

* Drive the motors by pressing button `A` and `B`. Turn Left by speed 50 when pressed button `A` and Turn Right by speed 50 when pressed button `B`.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    iBIT.Turn(turn.Left, 50)
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, () => {
    iBIT.Turn(turn.Right, 50)
})
```

* Spin the motors by pressing button `A` and `B`. Spin Left by speed 50 when pressed button `A` and Spin Right by speed 50 when pressed button `B`.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    iBIT.Spin(spin.Left, 50)
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, () => {
    iBIT.Spin(spin.Right, 50)
})
```

* Example for Servo, drive the servo motor's movement angle at Servo output 1 and 2 from `0 - 180` and back to 0 to restart again. 

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    for (let Degree = 0; Degree <= 180; Degree++) {
        iBIT.Servo(servo.SV1, Degree)
        iBIT.Servo(servo.SV2, Degree)
        basic.pause(10)
        while (Degree == 180) {
            Degree = 0
        }
    }
})
```
